# Filament sensor simplified

This plugin reacts to short lever microswitch output like [this](https://chinadaier.en.made-in-china.com/product/ABVJkvyMAqcT/China-1A-125VAC-on-off-Kw10-Mini-Micro-Mouse-Switch.html)
If triggered (switch open) it issues **M600 X0 Y0** command to printer.

Let's check some features:
* pop-up notification when printer runs out of filament
* very handy pop-up when printer requires user input while changing filament
* test button so you know if your sensor really works or not
* filament check at the start of the print - if no filament present it won't start printing, again pop-up will appear
* filament check at the end of filament change - just to be sure you won't start printing with no filament
* user defined number of verification checks - handy to mitigate false triggers from noisy signal wires
* check if printer supports M600 when printer connected - if not user will be notified through pop-up
* info pop-up when plugin hasn't been configured
* filament runouts can be repeatable which didn't work with other plugins I tried
* user-friendly and easy to configure
* pin validation so you don't accidentally save wrong pin number
* runs on OctoPrint 1.3.0 and higher

**NOTE: this plugin won't work if you use OctoPrint only to start printing from SD card**

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

Configuration couldn't be simpler, all you need is to configure listening board pin (board mode) and if the second switch terminal is connected to ground or 3.3V.

Default pin is -1 (not configured) and ground (as it is safer, read below).

**WARNING! Never connect the switch input to 5V as it could fry the GPIO section of your Raspberry!**

**WARNING! When using test button on input pin used by other application it will reset internal pull up/down resistor**

#### Advice

You might experience the same problem as I experienced - the sensor was randomly triggered. Turns out that if running sensor wires along motor wires, it was enough to interfere with sensor reading.

To solve this connect a shielded wire to your sensor and ground the shielding, ideally on both ends.

If this still does not solve the random trigger issue, or you are unable to implement these solutions, you can increase the number of verification checks in the settings. Note: Each verification takes 0.05 seconds, so if your sensor is very close to your extruder, you may not want to set this number too high. I found 5-10 verifications to be more than sufficient in my testing.

If you are unsure about your sensor being triggered, check [OctoPrint logs](https://community.octoprint.org/t/where-can-i-find-octoprints-and-octopis-log-files/299)
